## What the authority requires

The Residency Malta Agency FAQ states that **policies with monthly payments are not acceptable**, and that eligible policies have premiums covering a full year, paid in advance. Evidence is recorded in `sources/MT_NOMAD_RESIDENCY_FAQ_2026-01-12.md`.

## How we evaluate

We check whether the product payment cadence matches the annual pre-paid requirement. If payment cadence is missing, the result becomes UNKNOWN.

## Check in the engine

Use the checker with a snapshot:

`/ui/?visa=MT_NOMAD_RESIDENCY_2026&snapshot=releases/2026-01-15`

## Common pitfalls

- Submitting a monthly subscription plan without proof of annual prepayment.
- Assuming “monthly” is acceptable because the insurer is reputable.

Always confirm the payment term in writing.
