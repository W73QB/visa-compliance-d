## What the authority requires

The BLS London checklist for Spain DNV lists insurance requirements including:
- Insurer authorized to operate in Spain
- Comprehensive and unlimited coverage
- No excess or co-payments
- No moratorium

Evidence is recorded in `sources/ES_DNV_BLS_LONDON_checklist_2026-01-12.pdf`.

## How we evaluate

We check each requirement against ProductFacts. If any required fact is missing, the result becomes UNKNOWN; if a requirement is violated, the result becomes RED.

## Current status in the checker

As of 2026-01-16, we do not list any GREEN products for Spain DNV because official evidence for no moratorium, no deductible,
unlimited coverage, and public system risk coverage is missing. If you have an official certificate or conditions, share them
so we can verify.
