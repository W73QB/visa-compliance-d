## What the authority requires

The BLS London checklist for Spain DNV lists insurance requirements including:

- No excess or co-payments
- No moratorium

Evidence is recorded in `sources/ES_DNV_BLS_LONDON_checklist_2026-01-12.pdf`.

## How we evaluate

We check each requirement against ProductFacts. If any required fact is missing, the result becomes UNKNOWN; if a requirement is violated, the result becomes RED.
