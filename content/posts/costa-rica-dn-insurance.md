## Plain-English summary

Costa Rica’s digital nomad program requires proof of health insurance for the entire authorized stay. A common issue is submitting a policy without clearly documented coverage limits. VisaFact highlights evidence excerpts so you can confirm the minimum coverage requirement.

If the authority updates its checklist, use the latest snapshot in the checker and avoid relying on outdated summaries.

Ask your insurer for a certificate that explicitly states the coverage amount.

## Common pitfalls

- Policies that do not show the minimum medical coverage in writing.
- Coverage dates that do not match the intended stay period.
- Missing evidence for required benefits or coverage scope.

## What to prepare

- A policy summary showing the medical coverage amount.
- Proof of coverage that spans the full visa validity.
- Any official checklist or authority note that confirms the requirement.
Keep the insurer’s contact information handy for verification requests.
