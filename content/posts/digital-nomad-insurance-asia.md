## What the authority requires

Verified subset as of 2026-01-16. Each item links to an official authority or program document.

- Malaysia (DE Rantau Nomad Pass): Medical Insurance Enrolment Certificate valid in Malaysia, includes dependents, minimum 3 months. Source: https://www.mdec.my/static/pdf/derantau/251105%20Mandatory%20Documents%20for%20Freelancer%20Final%20V1%20.pdf

Asia routes vary widely. Some list explicit coverage requirements, while others omit insurance entirely. VisaFact marks those cases as NOT_REQUIRED or UNKNOWN depending on evidence.

If a route does not list insurance, that is **not** the same as “insurance never requested.” Some applicants are asked for proof after submission. Keep a policy summary ready, and confirm the latest checklist for your authority before applying.

VisaFact links to evidence snapshots so you can see exactly what was verified.

Always compare the checklist date to your planned application date.
