## What the authority requires

The VFS Global checklist for the E11 Temporary Stay Visa for Remote Work requires **valid travel insurance covering necessary medical expenses**, including urgent medical assistance and possible repatriation. Evidence is recorded in `sources/PT_E11_VFS_CHINA_2025-07.pdf`.

## How we evaluate

We check whether a product includes travel medical coverage that meets the requirement. Missing facts result in UNKNOWN.

## Check in the engine

Use the checker with a snapshot:

`/ui/?visa=PT_DNV_VFS_CHINA_2026&snapshot=releases/2026-01-15`

## Mapping results summary

As of snapshot `releases/2026-01-15`, the checker evaluated 7 products — all are GREEN:

| Status | Count |
|---|---|
| GREEN | 7 |

The structured requirement currently encoded in the checker is that insurance is mandatory. Because no other constraints are represented as requirements for this route, all products pass the automated check.

This does not mean there are no other checklist details in the source document. If additional requirements are encoded in future snapshots, some products may shift to RED or UNKNOWN.

## Plain-English summary

Portugal E11 routes can differ by authority. This page summarizes the verified insurance requirements and points to the official evidence so you can avoid assumptions.

When in doubt, use the checker with your specific route to validate coverage against evidence snapshots.

If a requirement lacks evidence, the checker will show UNKNOWN so you can request clarification from the authority.

## Common pitfalls

- Relying on generic travel insurance advice instead of route-specific requirements.
- Submitting a policy with missing evidence for required coverage features.
- Missing proof of coverage duration aligned with the visa period.
- Not having documentation that shows active coverage for your intended dates.

## What to prepare

- A policy summary showing medical coverage and repatriation benefits.
- Proof of coverage amount matching the checklist requirement (often €30,000).
- A coverage period aligned with the visa duration.
Keep a PDF of the policy terms so you can attach it if requested.
