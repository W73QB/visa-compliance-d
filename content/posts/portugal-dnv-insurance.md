## What the authority requires

The VFS Global checklist for the E11 Temporary Stay Visa for Remote Work requires **valid travel insurance covering necessary medical expenses**, including urgent medical assistance and possible repatriation. Evidence is recorded in `sources/PT_E11_VFS_CHINA_2025-07.pdf`.

## How we evaluate

We check whether a product includes travel medical coverage that meets the requirement. Missing facts result in UNKNOWN.

## Check in the engine

Use the checker with a snapshot:

## Plain-English summary

Portugal E11 routes can differ by authority. This page summarizes the verified insurance requirements and points to the official evidence so you can avoid assumptions.

When in doubt, use the checker with your specific route to validate coverage against evidence snapshots.

If a requirement lacks evidence, the checker will show UNKNOWN so you can request clarification from the authority.

## Common pitfalls

- Relying on generic travel insurance advice instead of route-specific requirements.
- Submitting a policy with missing evidence for required coverage features.
- Missing proof of coverage duration aligned with the visa period.

## What to prepare

- A policy summary showing medical coverage and repatriation benefits.
- Proof of coverage amount matching the checklist requirement (often €30,000).
- A coverage period aligned with the visa duration.
