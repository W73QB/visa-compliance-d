## What the authority requires

Visa requirements differ by route. The checker uses official sources for each visa (for example, Spain DNV requirements are captured in `sources/ES_DNV_BLS_LONDON_checklist_2026-01-12.pdf`).

## How we evaluate

We compare VisaFacts against ProductFacts. The product facts below are tied to evidence in `sources/`:
- **SafetyWing**: summary snapshot in `sources/SAFETYWING_WEBSITE_2026-01-12.md` (synthetic summary)
- **World Nomads Explorer**: emergency medical coverage from `sources/WORLDNOMADS_COMPARE_2026-01-15.html`
- **Genki Traveler**: deductible and coverage limit from `sources/GENKI_TRAVELER_COVERAGE_2026-01-15.html`

### Product facts we can verify

| Product | Evidence-backed facts |
|---|---|
| SafetyWing Nomad | Deductible $250; coverage limit $250,000; monthly subscription (synthetic summary) |
| World Nomads Explorer | Emergency medical coverage $150,000 |
| Genki Traveler | €50 deductible; €1,000,000 coverage limit; max coverage period 1 year |

## How to interpret this comparison

This comparison focuses on **evidence-based compliance**, not marketing claims. If evidence is missing, we show **UNKNOWN** rather than guessing. Always check the route-specific requirements for your visa.

## Quick chooser

- If a route requires **no deductibles**, avoid products with fixed deductibles.
- If a route requires **authorized local insurers**, prioritize products with evidence of authorization.
- If requirements are unclear, prefer products with documented evidence and use the checker to validate.

## Evidence coverage notes

Some product facts are based on official documents, while others rely on limited public summaries. VisaFact labels missing evidence as UNKNOWN to avoid over-claiming compliance. When possible, prefer products with explicit policy documents that match visa checklist language.

If a product’s evidence is incomplete, treat the result as a starting point and verify with the authority checklist.
