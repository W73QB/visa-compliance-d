faq:
  - question: "Is insurance required for Thailand DTV?"
    answer: "Current MFA checklist shows no insurance requirement; engine marks NOT_REQUIRED. Requirements may change—always confirm latest list."
  - question: "Should I still buy insurance?"
    answer: "Prudent to buy for medical costs; not mandated but sensible for travel/health risks."
  - question: "How does the checker handle missing evidence?"
    answer: "If no official source confirms a requirement, status stays UNKNOWN/NOT_REQUIRED rather than guessing."

## What the authority requires

The official DTV required documents list does not list insurance. Evidence: Thai MFA DTV requirements captured in `sources/TH_DTV_MFA_requirements_2026-01-12.md`. Consulate requirements can vary, so verify the current checklist for your filing location.

## How we evaluate

If the authority does not require insurance, the engine returns NOT_REQUIRED. See `/methodology/` for evaluation details.

## Check in the engine

Use the checker with a snapshot: `/ui/?visa=TH_DTV_MFA_2026&product=SAFETYWING_NOMAD_2026&snapshot=releases/2026-01-15`

## Plain-English summary

Thailand DTV routes may not mandate insurance today, but requirements can change. VisaFact highlights evidence so you can see what is verified vs UNKNOWN.

If your route changes, update your snapshot and re-check before submitting.

## Why NOT_REQUIRED matters

When the checker returns NOT_REQUIRED, it means:

- The official documents list does not mention insurance.
- No product can be GREEN or RED because there is no requirement to evaluate against.
- Buying insurance is a personal risk decision, not a compliance requirement.

This is different from UNKNOWN (where a requirement exists but evidence is missing).

## Common pitfalls

- Assuming “not required” means no proof will ever be requested.
- Using a policy with unclear coverage or missing evidence.
- Confusing NOT_REQUIRED with "insurance is unnecessary." The visa does not require it, but medical costs can still be significant without coverage.

## What to prepare (if you choose coverage)

- A policy summary that clearly states coverage limits and regions.
- Proof of active coverage for your intended stay period.
- Any official document showing your policy details in English.
Keep the insurer’s contact details available in case officials request verification.
