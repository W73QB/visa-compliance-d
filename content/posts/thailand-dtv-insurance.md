## What the authority requires

The Thai E‑Visa DTV requirements list does not mention any insurance requirement. Evidence: Thai MFA DTV requirements captured in `sources/TH_DTV_MFA_requirements_2026-01-12.md`.

## How we evaluate

If the authority does not require insurance, the engine returns NOT_REQUIRED. See `/methodology/` for evaluation details.
