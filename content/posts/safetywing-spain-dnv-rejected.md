## What the authority requires

The official BLS London checklist for Spain DNV requires health insurance that:
- Is issued by an insurer **authorized to operate in Spain**.
- Has **no excess or co-payments** and **no moratorium**.
- Provides **comprehensive and unlimited coverage**.

Evidence is recorded in `sources/ES_DNV_BLS_LONDON_checklist_2026-01-12.pdf`.

## How we evaluate

We compare each requirement to the ProductFacts record for SafetyWing in the current dataset. If any required fact is missing or conflicts, the status turns RED or UNKNOWN.

Note: ProductFacts for SafetyWing are based on a snapshot summary in `sources/SAFETYWING_WEBSITE_2026-01-12.md`. If you have an official policy document, compare it against the checklist and update the source.
