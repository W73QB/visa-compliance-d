## What the authority requires

The German Federal Foreign Office (UK) states that applicants for any category D visa must have health insurance cover commensurate with the German statutory system, and that **travel insurance is not sufficient**. Evidence is recorded in `sources/DE_HEALTH_INSURANCE_REQUIREMENTS_2026-01-15.html`.

## How we evaluate

We check whether the product is travel insurance and flag travel policies as non-compliant when the authority rejects travel insurance for D visas.
