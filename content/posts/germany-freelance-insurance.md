faq:
  - question: "Is travel insurance accepted for Germany freelance visa?"
    answer: "No. Authorities require coverage equivalent to German statutory health insurance; travel insurance is explicitly insufficient."
  - question: "Do I need unlimited coverage?"
    answer: "Policies should match statutory coverage levels, including outpatient, inpatient, and repatriation; no deductibles is safest."
  - question: "Can I use international insurers?"
    answer: "Yes if they meet statutory equivalence and provide German-language confirmation; evidence-backed products in the checker list those."

## What the authority requires

The German Federal Foreign Office (UK) states that applicants for any category D visa must have health insurance cover commensurate with the German statutory system, and that **travel insurance is not sufficient**. Evidence is recorded in `sources/DE_HEALTH_INSURANCE_REQUIREMENTS_2026-01-15.html`.

## How we evaluate

We check whether the product is travel insurance and flag travel policies as non-compliant when the authority rejects travel insurance for D visas.

## Plain-English summary

Germany’s freelance visa routes often expect health coverage equivalent to the statutory system, not travel-only coverage. VisaFact highlights verified evidence so you can see which requirements are confirmed and which remain UNKNOWN.

If your policy documentation cannot demonstrate statutory equivalence, the application is at higher risk of rejection even if the insurer is reputable.

When possible, request written confirmation from the insurer that maps coverage to statutory benefits.

## Common pitfalls

- Submitting travel insurance when long-stay health coverage is required.
- Assuming a provider is accepted without route-specific evidence.

## What to prepare

- A policy document describing benefits comparable to statutory coverage.
- Confirmation of coverage for inpatient/outpatient care and repatriation.
- Any authority-specific checklist items from the embassy route.
Keep a short, written confirmation from the insurer in case the consulate asks for proof.
