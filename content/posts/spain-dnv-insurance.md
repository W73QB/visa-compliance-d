## What the authority requires

Spain Digital Nomad Visa (BLS London) requires health insurance contracted with an insurer authorized to operate in Spain and covering risks insured by the Spanish public health system. The policy must be comprehensive with unlimited coverage, no deductibles or co-payments, and no moratorium. Evidence: BLS checklist (page 2, item 9) stored under `sources/ES_DNV_BLS_LONDON_checklist_2026-01-12.pdf`.

## Plain-English summary

Spain DNV authorities ask for **comprehensive, Spain-authorized health insurance** that mirrors the public system. If any requirement lacks official evidence, the checker returns **UNKNOWN** instead of guessing. This matters because a policy can look fine on paper but still fail a specific route’s checklist.

## Common pitfalls

- Buying travel-only policies when a full health policy is required.
- Accepting deductibles or co-payments when the route requires zero.
- Paying monthly when a full annual policy is expected.

## What to prepare

- A policy document showing the insurer is authorized to operate in Spain.
- Evidence that coverage is comprehensive, with no deductibles or co-payments.
- Proof of coverage period matching your intended stay (often annual prepaid).
