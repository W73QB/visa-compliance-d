 Affiliate Disclosure (Transparency)

{{< vf-trust >}}
All results are evidence-based. Missing evidence -> UNKNOWN.

Some links on this website may be affiliate links.

This means that if you click a link and purchase a product, we may earn a commission at no extra cost to you.

## 1) Independence and integrity

Our compliance results are **not** determined by affiliate relationships.

The checker output is generated from:

- Official visa requirements (VisaFacts) with evidence excerpts
- Product facts (ProductFacts) with evidence excerpts
- A rules engine that compares the two (Mappings)

If evidence is missing, the result will be **UNKNOWN**, even if a product is an affiliate partner.

## 2) No paid placement guarantee

We do not accept payment to change:

- a requirement record
- a product fact record
- a compliance status

Products may be presented as options only when they satisfy criteria derived from the recorded requirements.

## 3) How to interpret suggestions

If the site displays products that meet requirements, this is a **filtering outcome** based on rules and evidenceâ€”not a personal recommendation.

You should always:

- Read the full policy wording
- Confirm current visa requirements with official sources
- Consider your own needs (age, medical history, travel plans, risk tolerance)

## 4) Questions

If you have concerns about affiliate links or potential conflicts of interest, you can contact us or open a report using the "Notify me of changes" function.
