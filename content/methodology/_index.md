# Methodology (How this checker works)

This site is an evidence-based compliance checker for visa insurance requirements.

We do **not** guess. We do **not** provide legal advice.  
When information is missing, we show **UNKNOWN**.

## 1) What we measure

For each visa route (country + visa type + authority/route), we capture:

- The insurance requirements stated by an official authority (laws, government sites, consulate/BLS checklists, agency FAQs).
- Evidence excerpts and a locator (page/section/article).
- A verification date (`last_verified`) and a source snapshot hash (SHA256).

For each insurance product, we capture:

- Product facts that can be verified (policy type, payment cadence, deductible, coverage limit, etc.).
- Evidence excerpts and a locator from the product’s official documents or pages.
- A version/date so the record is tied to a specific policy snapshot.

## 2) Data model

We use a 3-layer model:

1) **VisaFacts** (law/authority facts)  
2) **ProductFacts** (product/policy facts)  
3) **Mappings** (engine output)

The checker result is generated by comparing VisaFacts against ProductFacts.

## 3) Evidence standard

Every requirement must include:

- `source_id` (the source document)
- `locator` (page/section/article)
- `excerpt` (the relevant text)

Every source is stored as a snapshot and hashed with SHA256 to preserve integrity.

## 4) Status definitions (Traffic Light)

- **GREEN (PASS)**: No rule violations detected based on available evidence.
- **YELLOW (CAUTION)**: Meets hard requirements, but there is an edge case or operational risk (e.g., cancellation risk for monthly subscriptions when a full-period policy is expected).
- **RED (FAIL)**: Violates at least one explicit requirement (e.g., deductible > 0 when “no excess/deductible” is required).
- **UNKNOWN**: Insufficient evidence to conclude (missing product facts or unclear authorization/terms).
- **NOT_REQUIRED**: The authority’s requirement list does not include insurance as a mandatory document.

## 5) Scope and limitations

- Requirements can vary by **authority**, **route**, and **time**.  
  We therefore store visa records with explicit scope (authority + route + version date).
- Policies can change. Product records are tied to a version/date.
- A GREEN result does not guarantee visa approval. Final decisions are made by the authority reviewing your application.

## 6) Reporting an update

If you believe a source has changed or a requirement is outdated:

- Use “Notify me of changes” (opens a report/issue).
- Provide the updated official link or document if possible.

We will review and update the relevant VisaFacts/ProductFacts record with evidence.
