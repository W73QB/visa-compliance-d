Methodology (How this checker works)

{{< vf-trust >}}
All results are evidence-based. Missing evidence -> UNKNOWN.
{{< /vf-trust >}}

This site is an evidence-based compliance checker for visa insurance requirements.

We do **not** guess. We do **not** provide legal advice.
When information is missing, we show **UNKNOWN**.

## 1) What we measure

For each visa route (country + visa type + authority/route), we capture:

- The insurance requirements stated by an official authority (laws, government sites, consulate/BLS checklists, agency FAQs).
- Evidence excerpts and a locator (page/section/article).
- A verification date (`last_verified`) and a source snapshot hash (SHA256).

For each insurance product, we capture:

- Product facts that can be verified (policy type, payment cadence, deductible, coverage limit, etc.).
- Evidence excerpts and a locator from the product's official documents or pages.
- A version/date so the record is tied to a specific policy snapshot.

## 2) How we extract requirements

- Identify the authoritative source for the specific route.
- Capture the requirement key, operator, and value.
- Store a short excerpt and a locator for the exact passage.
- Save the source in `sources/` and record its SHA256 hash in the `.meta.json` file.

## 3) Data model

We use a 3-layer model:

1) **VisaFacts** (law/authority facts)
2) **ProductFacts** (product/policy facts)
3) **Mappings** (engine output)

The checker result is generated by comparing VisaFacts against ProductFacts.

## 4) How the rule engine evaluates

- Each requirement is evaluated against a specific product fact.
- If evidence is missing for a required fact, the status becomes **UNKNOWN**.
- If a requirement is explicitly violated, the status becomes **RED**.
- If requirements are met but there is an operational risk (example: monthly payments when full-period coverage is required), the status becomes **YELLOW**.
- If no violations are found and evidence is complete, the status is **GREEN**.

## 5) Evidence standard

Every requirement must include:

- `source_id` (the source document)
- `locator` (page/section/article)
- `excerpt` (the relevant text)

Every source is stored as a snapshot and hashed with SHA256 to preserve integrity.

## 6) SHA256 verification

To verify a source:

- Compute the SHA256 hash of the local file.
- Compare it to the `sha256` recorded in the source `.meta.json`.
- A mismatch means the source file has changed and must be re-verified.

## 7) Status definitions (Traffic Light)

- **GREEN (PASS)**: No rule violations detected based on available evidence.
- **YELLOW (CAUTION)**: Meets hard requirements, but there is an edge case or operational risk.
- **RED (FAIL)**: Violates at least one explicit requirement.
- **UNKNOWN**: Insufficient evidence to conclude.
- **NOT_REQUIRED**: The authority does not require insurance for the route.

## 8) Scope and limitations

- Requirements can vary by **authority**, **route**, and **time**.
- Policies can change; product records are tied to a specific version/date.
- A GREEN result does not ensure visa approval. Final decisions are made by the authority.

## 9) Reporting an update

If you believe a source has changed or a requirement is outdated:

- Use "Notify me of changes" (opens a report/issue).
- Provide the updated official link or document if possible.

We will review and update the relevant VisaFacts/ProductFacts record with evidence.

## What the authority requires

We only include requirements that appear in official sources for the route.

## How we evaluate

See /methodology/ for the step-by-step approach and data model.
