## What the authority requires

Under the EU Visa Code (Article 15), applicants must have travel medical insurance that:
- Covers repatriation for medical reasons, urgent medical attention, emergency hospital treatment, or death.
- Is valid throughout the territory of the Member States and for the entire period of stay or transit.
- Has a minimum coverage of **EUR 30,000**.

Evidence is recorded in `sources/EU_VISA_CODE_ARTICLE_15_2026-01-15.html`.

## How we evaluate

We compare these requirements against ProductFacts and mark missing or conflicting facts as UNKNOWN or RED.

If a route references the Schengen rule, the €30,000 minimum is the baseline. Authorities may add extra conditions (e.g., zero deductible or specific insurer constraints).
