## What the authority requires

We only list requirements that are stated by the official authority for the route.

## How we evaluate

We compare VisaFacts against ProductFacts using a rule engine. Details: /methodology/

Example note: As of 2026-01-16, Spain DNV has no GREEN products because official evidence for key requirements is missing.
