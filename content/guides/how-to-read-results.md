## What the authority requires

We only list requirements that are stated by the official authority for the route.

## How we evaluate

We compare VisaFacts against ProductFacts using a rule engine. Details: /methodology/

Example note: As of 2026-01-16, Spain DNV has a GREEN product (ASISA Health Residents) based on official evidence.

## Status meanings (plain English)

- **GREEN**: Evidence shows the product meets the stated requirement.
- **YELLOW**: Partially meets requirements or evidence is mixed.
- **RED**: Evidence conflicts with a requirement.
- **UNKNOWN**: No official evidence found for the requirement.
- **NOT_REQUIRED**: The authority does not require that feature.

Use the snapshot date to see when the evidence was last verified.
