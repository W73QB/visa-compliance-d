## 2025-01-29 - Modal Focus Management
**Learning:** Modals must manage focus manually (saving the active element on open and restoring it on close) and include ARIA `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"` attributes to be accessible to screen reader and keyboard users.
**Action:** Always implement focus trap/restore and proper ARIA roles when creating or modifying overlay components.
