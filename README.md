# Visa Compliance Database

This is a compliance-first visa insurance platform.

We do NOT provide legal advice.
We provide:
- What official authorities require (VisaFacts)
- What insurance products actually provide (ProductFacts)
- An automated rule engine that compares them (Mappings)

Everything must be backed by primary sources (laws, consulate checklists, government agencies).

No source = UNKNOWN.
UNKNOWN > Wrong.
